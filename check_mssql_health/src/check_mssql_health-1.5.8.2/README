check_mssql_health Nagios Plugin README
---------------------

This plugin is used to monitor a variety of MS SQL Server database metrics. 

* For instructions on installing this plugin for use with Nagios,
  see below. In addition, generic instructions for the GNU toolchain
  can be found in the INSTALL file.

* For major changes between releases, read the CHANGES file.

* For information on detailed changes that have been made,
  read the Changelog file.

* This plugin is self documenting.  All plugins that comply with
  the basic guidelines for development will provide detailed help when
  invoked with the '-h' or '--help' options.

Please include the OS type/version and the Perl DBI/DBD version
that you are using.
Also, run the plugin with the '-vvv' option and provide the resulting 
version information.  Of course, there may be additional diagnostic information
required as well.  Use good judgment.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------
You need to install the Perl module DBD::Sybase first.
It is very important to set the protocol version in /etc/freetds.conf to 8.0
Otherwise your database password will be visible on the network.

[global]
        # TDS protocol version
        tds version = 8.0



How to "compile" the check_mssql_health script.
--------------------------------------------------------

1) Run the configure script to initialize variables and create a Makefile, etc.

	./configure --prefix=BASEDIRECTORY --with-nagios-user=SOMEUSER --with-nagios-group=SOMEGROUP --with-perl=PATH_TO_PERL --with-statefiles-dir=STATE_PATH

   a) Replace BASEDIRECTORY with the path of the directory under which Nagios
      is installed (default is '/usr/local/nagios')
   b) Replace SOMEUSER with the name of a user on your system that will be
      assigned permissions to the installed plugins (default is 'nagios')
   c) Replace SOMEGRP with the name of a group on your system that will be
      assigned permissions to the installed plugins (default is 'nagios')
   d) Replace PATH_TO_PERL with the path where a perl binary can be found.
      Besides the system wide perl you might have installed a private perl
      just for the nagios plugins (default is the perl in your path).
   e) Replace STATE_PATH with the directory where you want the script to
      write state files which transport information from one run to the next.
      (default is /tmp)

   Simply running ./configure will be sufficient to create a check_mssql_health
   script which you can customize later.
      

2) "Compile" the plugin with the following command:

	make

    This will produce a "check_mssql_health" script. You will also find
    a "check_mssql_health.pl" which you better ignore. It is the base for
    the compilation filled with placeholders. These will be replaced during
    the make process.


3) Install the compiled plugin script with the following command:

	make install

   The installation procedure will attempt to place the plugin in a 
   'libexec/' subdirectory in the base directory you specified with
   the --prefix argument to the configure script.


4) Verify that your configuration files for Nagios contains
   the correct paths to the new plugin.


Command line parameters
-----------------------

--hostname=<the database server>
   This is the hostname or the ip-address.

--port=<the instance port>
   This is the port where an instance listens. Default: 1433

--server=<the database server>
   This can be used instead of a hostname/port combination.
   The servername given here is used for a lookup in /etc/freetds.conf

--user=<username>
   This is the user which reads the system tables.

--password=<secret>
   This is the user's password.

--mode=<operation mode>
   This parameter tells the plugin what it should check.
   The list of known modes may grow frequently. Please look at 
   http://www.consol.com/opensource/nagios/check-mssql-health for a list
   of features.

--database=<database name>
  Database-related modes check all databases in one run by default.
  If only a single database should be checked, use this parameter.

--warning=<warning threshold>
  If the metric is out of this range, the plugin returns a warning.

--critical=<critical threshold>
  If the metric is out of this range, the plugin returns a critical.

   
Connecting 
----------


You can call the plugin with "--hostname <ip or dns-name> [--port <port number>]"
This bypasses the freetds.conf file and directly connects you to 
whatever is listening on port 1433 or <port number>
This will surely be the default instance. If you have different (named) instances
listening on the same port, you need to edit /etc/freetds.conf

[dbsrv1instance01] 
        host = 192.168.1.1 
        port = 1433 
        instance = instance01 
        
[dbsrv1instance02] 
        host = 192.168.1.1 
        port = 1433 
        instance = instance02 

....

Then you call the plugin with "--server dbsrv1instance02" for example.

Testing the connection
----------------------

use DBI;
use strict;

my $username = "xxxxx";
my $password = "xxxxx";
my $dsn = "DBI:Sybase:;host=127.0.1.1;port=1433";
#my $dsn = "DBI:Sybase:;server=dbsrv_in_freetds_conf";
if (my $dbh = DBI->connect(
    $dsn, $username, $password,
    { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 0, PrintError => 1 })) {
  printf "connection succeeded\n";
} else {
  printf "connection failed\n";
}
